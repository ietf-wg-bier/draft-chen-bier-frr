generally, the comments from mailing list need to be solved: https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/bier/_hkJHD_hur1KqibUlDOgMf0R3Mc/;
As pointed out in Greg’s email, there is no architecture section in the draft.
As pointed out in Greg’s email, there is no explicit description of "BIER inheriting FRR functions from unicast". 
The description of ECMP can also provide FRR protection needs to be added in the draft.
Language improvement is needed for better understanding. The draft needs more review.
